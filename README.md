## Sprint 1

To make a simple working prototype of our game, we added a player with movement, animations, a camera that follows him,
as well as a basic tilemap created with TILED. Here's a permanent link to play [Sprint 1: The Prototype](//v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/5297206/index.html).

## Sprint 2

To make a proof of environment art for our game, we added a several short maps and their tilesets, an attacking feature,
as well as backgrounds that correspond to the levels. Here's a permanent link to play [Sprint 2: The Environment](//).

## Sprint 3

To make visible gameplay for our game, we added the first level, the Lab, functional enemy mechanics and player health, 
as well as a basic puzzle system. Here's a permanent link to play [Sprint 3: The Gameplay](//v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/5387180/index.html).

## Sprint 4

To showcase a Pre-Alpha, we made the puzzle fully functional and go to an Elevator System, we added UI in hearts that can be added to, taken away, and edited dynamically, as well as completed an entire second level to show how the game would expand.

## Sprint 5

To mark a half-way point, we playtested everything with the help of fellow students, and went back and fixed a majority of bugs. In doing this, we added a Powerups UI, as well as their pickup counterpart, fixed colliders everywhere in the game, from stairs, to enemies, to buttons, as well as added new enemy functionality: targetting the player. Also, we added a "Death Screen" and prompt the player to respawn. Here's a permanent link to play [Sprint 5: Half-Way](//v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/5495801/index.html).
