# Time Trodden

A game made in Phaser 3 for CS329E: Elements of Game Development.

You must break time in order to save it! Travel through your time-broken world, fight enemies, 
find loot, and solve puzzles, all the while finding your way to the Boss!

It's TIME to save time!

## Sprint 1

To make a simple working prototype of our game, we added a player with movement, animations, a camera that follows him,
as well as a basic tilemap created with TILED. Here's a permanent link to play [Sprint 1: The Prototype](//v6p9d9t4.ssl.hwcdn.net/html/5297206/index.html).
